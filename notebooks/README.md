# Notebook examples / tutorials / tests

This folder contains a number of Jupyter notebooks in script format that serve as examples or tutorials for using the biological circuits defined here. They also serve as integration tests.

The easiest way to use the scripts is to open them in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and run them cell by cell. Another approach is to use [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert them to notebooks, and then run them in your favorite notebook IDE.
